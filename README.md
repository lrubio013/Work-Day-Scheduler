# Work Day Scheduler

## About
This application will allow a user to better plan out a day.

##  How it works
The planner will grey out hours that already happened to show users that they can no longer plan out hours that already happened. 
The planner will highlight the current hour in red and highlight upcoming hours in green. The planner will also save the events and will stay even if the website gets refreshed.
